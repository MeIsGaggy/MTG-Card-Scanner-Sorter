I am putting all of my effort to get the scanning app as efficient and reliable as possible before designing anything physical, but I will eventially make files that will allow anyone with an FDM 3D printer to be able use this application if they are that dedicated to their Magic collection.

Planned filed include, but are not limited to:
- Suction system with suction cups, syringe and mount with stepper motor attachment (reuse the extruder stepper from the Creatlity Sprite Extruder)
- Main head (idk what to call it but it will mount on the printer and have a mount for a phone/webcam, suction module, etc)
